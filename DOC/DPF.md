# Fake News Detector using AI 

## Why Fake News Detection
Fake news on internet have been spreading since the conception of internet itself.
They are more of a threat than nuisance now more than ever. Mainly because of shear number of people using internet in 21st century. Any chance to curb or even eliminate them is too little of a chance. And since fake news are generated every second, it is impossible to check them at the source rather using Artifical Intelligence integrated into various sites can help prevent their spread.

## Major Challenges
- Hardware Requirements (GPUs) 
- Feature Extraction
- Accuracy
- Formulation of equations
- Human Error
- Detection of articles as news or not

## Learning Outcomes
- Various Machine Learning algorithms used in industries to solve problems.
- Mathematics used for developing ML algorithms.
- Version control using Git.
- Working of Decentralised apps. 
- Natural Language Processing. 

## Features
- Detect click bait links
- Decentralized News application
- Social Media Fake News detection
- Retraining model on daily basis (using News Websites)
