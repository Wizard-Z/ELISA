# ELISA(Exploratory Language Interlaced Scanning of Articles) - The AI for Fake News Detection

## Why Fake News Detection
Fake news on internet have been spreading since the conception of internet itself. They are more of a threat than nuisance, more than ever. Mainly because of shear number of people using internet in 21st century. Any chance to curb or even eliminate them is too little of a chance. And since fake news are generated every second, it is impossible to check them at the source. But using Artifical Intelligence techniques and the world of Blockchain, it is now possible to integrate these technologies where news reporters from around the world can join together spread
